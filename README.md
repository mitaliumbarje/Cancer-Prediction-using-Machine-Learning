Hey Fellas!!
Welcome to my repository...
I have made a machine learning model that predicts if a person has cancer or not.
I have developed a frontend and integrated the ML model in backend that uses logistic regression.

Steps for implementation:
1. install all required libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, joblib, Flask, flask-cors, etc) by running "pip install <library_name>" in terminal
2. compile and run train_model file in terminal by "python train_model.py" command in terminal
3. compile and run app file in terminal by "python app.py" command in terminal
4. keep it running and open index.html using live server or open using browser
